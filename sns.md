<h2> SNS (Simple Notification Service) </h2>

- Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed publisher/subscriber messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.
- Amazon SNS provides topics for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging. Using Amazon SNS topics, your publisher systems can fan out messages to a large number of subscriber endpoints for parallel processing, including Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, and HTTP/S webhooks.
- Additionally, SNS can be used to fan out notifications to end users using mobile push, SMS, and email.
- You can get started with Amazon SNS in minutes by using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or AWS Software Development Kit (SDK).
